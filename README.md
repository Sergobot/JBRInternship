# JetBrains Research Internship
My solutions to the JetBrains Summer Internship qualification tasks.

> Here's a nice [video demonstration](https://sergobot.me/bipedal_walker.mp4) of how TD3 model behaves. It is produced by recording every 50th episode during the training process.

> Not-as-fancy [demonstration](https://sergobot.me/mountain_car.mp4) of DDQN algorithm in the MountainCar setting.

Even though the training process heavily depends on the CPU, as gym computations are happening there,
I made a good use of laptop's built-in GeForce MX150 to speed trainig up almost twice! Especially the
TD3 algorithm, as its implemetation features larger layers.
